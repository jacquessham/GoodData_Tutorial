# GoodData Tutorial
GoodData is a great business intelligence tool for multi-tenancy use cases. However, GoodData offers a community edition (GoodData.CN) to be used without any charge for personal usage. Any action in GoodData.CN is made by calling declarative APIs to update the change in GoodData.CN. In this repository, we will go over how to use GoodData.CN to build your dashboard.

## Basics
Coming soon...

## Setup
GoodData.CN community edition can be hosted via Docker and requires a database to query from. In the [Setup](/Setup) folder, you may find the instruction on how to setup both GoodData.CN and Postgres database with Docker.

## Connect to Postgres
Once the GoodData.CN is running, the first step is to connect with a database. We will be using Postgres as the example database. You may find the instruction in the [Connection](/Connection) folder.
